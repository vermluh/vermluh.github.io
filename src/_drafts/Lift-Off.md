So here it is. My first blog attempt. First of all the posts published here should be used as some sort of self-documentation regarding my more or less meaningful experiments in the wide world of software development. If there is something that you find useful, just go ahead and use it for your own purposes.  

Ich habe mich bewusst für [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), genauer [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) entschieden, da ich möglichst wenig Zeremonie um das Erstellen und Editieren der Blog Posts haben möchte.  

[jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) lässt sich folgendermaßen sehr kurz beschreiben (Zitat):  
> Jekyll is a static site generator that's perfect for GitHub hosted blogs [(Jekyll repository)](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)  
> Jekyll Now makes it easier to create your Jekyll blog, by eliminating a lot of the up front setup.  

As a software developer I see myself as belonging to the lazier part of the world's population. So the part  

> eliminating a lot of the up front setup

sounded very promising. :-)
